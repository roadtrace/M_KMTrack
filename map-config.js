/* KMTrack — MapTiler browser configuration.
 *
 * The API key is a PUBLIC browser key: it is necessarily visible in the tile
 * requests the browser makes, exactly like the CARTO key it sits beside. It is
 * restricted to roadtrace.github.io, so it is useless from any other origin.
 * Keep it here and nowhere else.
 *
 * This style is used by the DARK basemap only. Light mode keeps the existing
 * CARTO Voyager raster, so switching themes never changes the light view.
 *
 * The MapTiler SDK, its stylesheet and the Leaflet plugin are vendored under
 * vendor/maptiler/ rather than loaded from a CDN, so there is no third-party
 * dependency at runtime. They are fetched on demand — the SDK is ~1.4 MB and
 * only dark mode needs it — and the service worker caches them on first use.

     * `apiKey`, so the endpoint is stored WITHOUT it; the full request is:
     *   https://api.maptiler.com/maps/<mapId>/style.json?key=<apiKey>       */
